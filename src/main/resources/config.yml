# Enable alternative messaging system.  Redis support is not directly dependant on RedisBungee, however is most useful in
# combination with it.  This setting will change message sending and recieving to run over a Redis publisher/subcriber instead
# of a bungeecord message sender/listener.  This setting can also be used for a lilypad or other proxy based network.

# CHECKS:
#   CATEGORY:
#     CHECK: VIOLATION
# You can set here the minimum required violation, which must be achieved so that the player gets reported to the other servers.
# Set violation to 0 or lower to disable the notification for the specific check.
# You do not have to set violation to -1 if the check was disabled in the NoCheatPlus configuration.
# You can set "enable-send" to false to avoid from sending notifications in general.
